# Lab04 - Terraform agents and the vSphere provider

In this lab, you will create a Terraform Cloud Workspace and configure it to work with TFDC and GitHUB VCS. Then you will deploy virtual machines on an on-prem ESXi host that is managed by vCenter. You will also learn how to use conditionals in HCL and how to create and use modules.
